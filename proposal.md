**For student**,
To begin with, I will let one of the student in a group check all the project detail then, one of them will
sent all the detail to their advisor.

**For advisor**
First of all, advisor will decide whether to deny or accept.
If the advisor decide to approve the project, the project will be sent to all the faculty to approve.
On the other hand, if the advisor deny, this project will be cancelled and their student 
have to summit their proposal again.

**For faculty**
I set up that whoever login  in the first 3 to approve the project then, the project will be approved.
Consequently, all the faculty that have not login yet their request will be canceled. 

In conclusion, after you have completed all the above requirements, your project status will be changed to
completeðŸ¥³.
